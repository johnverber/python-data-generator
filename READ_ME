Name: Python Data-Generator

Author: John Verber

Version 1.1

It still works the same.  I just added a main.py.  And some success messages.

In order to run this simply run it with python main.py.  See below for more description.


Version: 1.0

Description: This script will generate 'people' data for between 1 to 1000 distinct records.  
It will output the data in the following formats: .txt, .csv, .json.  
The data per record is as follows: Last Name, First Name, Email, Address, and Phone number.  

Note: The last names are shared between the male and female names.  So some records may contain the same last name.
But all first names are distinct.  


System Requirements: Python
I ran this with Python 3.6.5, but it should run on Python 2.7 as well.  
When I get around to it I will test it on Python 2.7 and update. 

Operating Instructions:
1) Run data_generator.py first, if you do not nothing else will work
    You can simply run data_generator.py with no arguments and it will ask you how many records you'd like.
    Or you can add the number of records you need as an argument:
        Ex:  python data_generator.py 500
    Running this script will result in data.txt (which csv_generator.py and json_writer.py uses)

2) Run either csv_generator.py or json_writer.py.  
   Running csv_generator.py will result in data.csv
   Running json_writer.py will result in data.json

Note I am planning on making a bat file for Windows and a bash file to run on Linux and MacOs.
When I finish those I will update

Files:
    Python files:
        data_generator.py (generates a txt file - data.txt - of a user defined number of data)
        csv_generator.py (generates a csv file from the data.txt file created by data_generator)
    Text Files:
        address.txt - file of 1000 random addresses
        phone.txt - file of 1000 random phone numbers
        female_done - file of 1000 random female first names and last names (comma separated)
        male_done - file of 1000 random male first names and last names (comma separated)
        data.txt - file created by data_generator.py 
        data.csv - file created by csv_generator.py

Known Bugs:
    None as of now.  But please update if you find one so it can be fixed.  Or better yet, fix it and update.  Thanks.
